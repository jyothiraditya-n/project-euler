# Project-Euler

These are my solutions to the questions on Project Euler. If you want to compile the code and run it yourself, type `make`. If you want to cross-compile for Windows, type `make all-win`. However, I have already provided the answers in the text files, so this may not be necessary.

For each question, the `.c` file is my answer's source code, the `.txt` file is the answer, and the `.html` file is the question.
